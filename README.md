# APPUPPET
Appuppet is a productivity web application that allows you to see and analyze the work you've done and gamifies personal development using a level system.

Whenever a user enters a (done) task, the site automatically scores it based on task duration and several user-set parameters (the default parameters are [from least to most influential]: task difficulty, task service [how much does the task serve your goals], and monetary gain/importance. All parameters are scored on a scale from 1 to 3, 3 being the greatest. Each user is required to either set their own parameters or use the default parameters when they sign up.)

By scoring each task, the website allows users to see their productivity in a meaningful way and allows them to see the changes in their productivity over time by displaying daily and weekly point totals. The site also sets daily goals using an algorithm that analyzes the user's points from the previous 30 days, with every day's points being more relevant than the day before's. These are displayed on a graph.

As the user improves themselves (as judged by the changes in their points,) they can 'level up'. Appuppet has a leaderboard where users can see how their self-improvement stacks up with other, willing users'. Entry into the leaderboard is completely voluntary.

Appuppet is completely free & open sourced and plans to stay that way permanently. We think it is absurd to tax you on your self-improvement. 
Appuppet also does not share any of the information it collects from users. Users provide us with what they do during the day- information that is valuable to many large companies- and we fully understand just how important it is to protect this information.

We humans are nowhere near perfectly efficient, and that's fine. This doesn't mean we can't help each other improve. Appuppet aims to do just that.

We hope to see you in our website!
